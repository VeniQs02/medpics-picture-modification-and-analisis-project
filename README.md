**Overview:**
Project started as an uni project, but i build aditional functionality on top of that. It takes radiograph pictures and modifies its gamma, and sharpness values to increase the visibility.
The results are a certain number of png files, named accordingly with the modification that was made, as well as the intensity of an operation that was performed. 

> Modifying values of rgb values are performed manually, without addidional packages

> User is able to determine the number and intensity of performed actions

> All files are being organized in directories

**Presentation:**

Picture modification is widely used in medicine, this example will be making the picture easier to read.
Here is the comparison of abdomen images with different gamma levels:

Next picture will be the sharpening effect used on human teeth:

Again gamma correction, but this time different image, where we can se how different an image may look based on the technology used to take the image:

**Usage:**

Running required java main file results in the app running. The user can customise settings to suit his needs of image processing.
